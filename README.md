# A rushed, simple E-Commerce Node Web App

* Uses [Express](https://expressjs.com/) web framework

* Utilizes [pug](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) template engine

* Login, logout with [JWT](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken)

* Hashes passwords using [BCrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt)

* Support more HTTP methods than ```GET``` and ```POST``` in HTML forms by using [method-override](https://www.npmjs.com/package/method-override) module

**This is only a rushed demo for a school project, so it doesn't conform to web server security practices and more. Furthermore, the design is not responsive or accessible**
